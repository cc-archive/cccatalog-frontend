## About
CC Search is a tool that allows openly licensed and public domain works to be discovered
and used by everyone. Creative Commons, the nonprofit behind CC Search, is the maker of the
[CC Licensed](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-examples/)
used over 1.4 billion times to help creators share knowledge and creativity online.

Repository containing the [CC Search](https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/) frontend application. This web app contains all the UI which communicates with the [CC Search API](https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog-api) to get the data that is rendered in the browser.

CC Search is an interface to search for content that is licensed under Creative Commons licenses or in the public domain.

##  Setup Environment
The frontend app is built using [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

### Getting Started

Run the following commands in order to have the code up and running on your machine:

### Method 1
``` bash
# In order that vue not install in your machine, latest stable
$ npm install vue

# installs dependencies
$ npm install

# Builds and serves assets with hot-reload
$ npm run dev
```

### Method 2 ~ Docker Setup

Alternatively, you can use Docker to build and run the application. You just have to run:

``` bash
$ docker-compose up
```

You should now have the application running and accessible at http://localhost:8443.

You don't need to have the CC Search API running locally to be able to run the frontend application. It's configured to communicate, by default, with the [API](https://api.creativecommons.engineering) that's already publicly available. If you wish, you can change the URL of the API that's used during development at https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog-frontend/blob/develop/config/.env#L5

In order to do contribution visit to [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog-frontend/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md) file

## Running tests

You can run the tests by executing:
``` bash
npm run test
```

## localhost tunneling

If you want to make your local development server accessible to the internet (for testing or showing someone something you're working on), you can use [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.com/). Follow the documentation on the `ngrok` site to install it and set it up. Once you have it installed, get the development server for CC Search running and in a separate window/tab, run:

```
# The extra parameters are required to ensure that ngrok redirects to the HTTPS version of the site
# and that the host header matches one that is accepted by the server
# (ngrok's default hostname is randomly generated and is not whitelisted).
ngrok http http://localhost:8443 -host-header="localhost:8443"
```

If you need to run a HTTP version (for example, if you're testing against third-party websites that do not accept the self-signed cerificate generated by the dev server), run the dev server using `npm run dev` and use the following command to start `ngrok`:

```
ngrok http 8443 -host-header="localhost:8443"
```

## Deployment

Details about how to deploy the frontend code can be found on the [CC Wiki](https://wikijs.creativecommons.org/tech/cc-search/frontend) (Accessible to CC Staff only).
