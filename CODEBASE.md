# Codebase overview

This document will give you a high level overview of the modules and components of the application and how they work together.

## Dependencies

The CC Search frontend is built using [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/) as its main view library. It uses [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) as its routing library and Vuex(https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) as state-management library. On our production environment, we also use [Server Side Rendering](https://ssr.vuejs.org/) of the Vue app.

The app uses [CC Vocabulary](https://github.com/creativecommons/vocabulary) as a base CSS library.

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) are used for build and compilation.

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is used for unit tests.

## Module structure

Caveat: this section doesn't render well on Github (or any other Markdown viewer). It's better to read this in raw format or in a text editor.

Below is a folder structure in the order recommended to understand how the app and its components are initialized.
```
 +-- src/
 | 
 |-- main.js
 |     Main entry point of the app. Initializes the base modules such as analytics, stores and routing system. Renders the root    component.
 |
 |-- App.vue
 |     App root component. All other components have this component as its parent
 |
 |-- router/(client|server).js
 |     Where the routes are defined. This is where the definitions of which page component will render for every route.
 |
 |-- store/*.js
 |     This is where the application stores are defined. Each store defines its base state, action and mutation handlers.
 |
 |-- pages/*.vue
 |     This is where the each page component is defined. Page components are the base components for each route. They define the page structure
 |     and how its sub-components are rendered. They also contain logic for loading data required to render its child components.
 |
 |-- components/*.vue
 |     Where individual sub-components are defined. Examples of sub-components include the navigation bar, individual photo details,
 |     photo tags, search results grid, etc..
 |
 |-- api/*.js
 |     Modules responsible for wrapping calls to the [CC Catalog API](https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog-api). This API
 |     is the base backend used to get the search results and image details.
 |
 |-- featureFlags/index.js
 |     A module used to read feature flags from environment variables, which are defined during build time, and exposing their values to the app.
 |     These feature flags are used mainly to enable/disable any given feature when necessary. Used mostly when testing new features and their behaviour before
 |     enabling them to all users.
 |
 |-- analytics/*.js
 |     Module responsible for sending real time events to Google Analytics triggered by user interaction with the application.
 |
 |-- assets/
 |     Where the static assets are stored. Assets include the source providers' logos and the CC license icons SVGs, which are used in the HTML embed feature.
 |     None of these files should be removed, unless a source provider is forever removed, then its logo image can probably be safely deleted.
 |
```

## Server side rendering

CC Search runs on our production environments with a Server Side Rendering (SSR) version of the VueJS app. Reading of the [Vue SSR Guide](https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/) is recommended to understand how it works and the differences that exist compared to running the app on the client-side only.

In order to run the SSR app locally, you just need to run the following commands.

```
$ npm install # if you haven't already
$ npm run build
$ npm run server
```

### Points of attention in the codebase for SSR

When you run `npm run server`, Node will run the [server.js](./server.js) script which starts an [Express.JS](https://expressjs.com/) web server, which will start listening on the configured port and accepting requests and rendering the Vue App, as well as serve static assets.

There are also a few cases of different components for server and client side rendering:

One is the entry file for webpack. You can find them in [clientEntry.js](./src/clientEntry.js) and [serverEntry.js](./src/serverEntry.js). These files are the point of entry of the application, they start the Vue ppp, the store and the router. There are some minor differences between them, such as polyfill loading and client-side state hydration which are done only on the `clientEntry`.

Because of legacy issues, there are three pages that have separate server and client versions:

* BrowsePage
* CollectionsBrowsePage
* PhotoDetailPage

The reason for that is that for some time we used a [JS library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue-masonry) to render the image grid. This library used browser specific APIs to render the image grid. Therefore it didn't work on the server renderer. So we had to split those pages into two different versions, one that didn't render the image grid (for the server) and another that did render it (for the client). There is however a [ticket](https://github.com/creativecommons/cccatalog-frontend/issues/934) related to removing this legacy complexity.

For this reason we need to be careful about using client specific APIs (such as `window`, `document`, etc.). If those are necessary, it can only run *only* on the client side, otherwise it will break on the server and the user will end up seeing an error message when loading the page.
